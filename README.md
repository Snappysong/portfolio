This is my portfolio page. It was the FIRST project I ever made and had a lot of fun working on it. When I started, it was just a basic black and white page with my picture stuck in the corner somewhere and now it has grown into something I feel proud of. Hopefully when I get some more time I can work on it more and make it more interactive and fluid for users to enjoy.
 
Eventually I would like to restyle my page into something a little more impressive, with more animations and page transitions. I am also looking into making a mobile app portfolio so I can get more acquainted with React Native.
