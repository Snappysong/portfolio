    <h2>Who is this guy?</h2> <!--Article Heading-->
        <p>Hey there! My name is Andrew and I am now a offical web developer! I am currently located in Puerto Rico and loving it! I was born in California and was raised in Washington state, so it's easy for me to find the good things about living in a city or a smaller town. With my new programming skills, I hope to find a remote job that gives me the freedom to travel and work at the same time! </p>
        
        <h3>When I am not programming I love to...</h3>
        <ul>  <!--this creates an unorganized list-->
            <li>Play DnD</li>     <!-- List elements--> 
            <li>Hit the gym</li>
            <li>Lounge around the house with my kitty</li>

    <h2>About me:</h2> <!-- article heading-->
        <p>So I am a very beginner web developer but I am full of ideas and eager to learn! I hope to be a part of a growing team that can work together to make something magical. I have several projects in mind, mostly things that have to do with Dungeons and Dragons or any other Tabletop RPGs. I also have some ideas for workout planners and nutrition trackers. I would prefer working freelance or remote so I get the chance to work and travel! There are many places I haven't been to yet in this world, but here are some of my favorites!</p>
